    <p>
        This recipe comes to us from my Cousin Elaine, by way of my Mom. I am not a cranberry sauce fan, but I am a fan of Elaineâ€™s sweet succulent cooking, so I am sure it is fantastic.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 orange</li>
        <li>2 cups cranberries</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In saucepan, finely zest peel of 1 orange, squeeze in juice of the orange, add cranberries, sugar and walnuts. Cook over medium heat stirring occasionally until mixture thickens and cranberries pop. Cool before serving. Best if made the day before serving.</p>
