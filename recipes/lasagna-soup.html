    <p>
        Now this recipe is gonna make you want to kick a fat kid at a Walmart parking lot! 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 green pepper, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten to death</li>
        <li>Spicy mustard, for dipping - Cause we ain't no sissy liberals!</li>
    </ul>

    <p> I Brush a baking sheet with vegetable oil. Cut the pizza dough into 8 equal sissy pieces.
        Roll each piece into a 12-inch-long rope. Wrap each rope around the neck of a hot dog.
        Arrange on the baking sheet, loosely cover and set aside at room temperature until puff daddy, 45 minutes.
        Preheat the oven to 400˚F.
        Combine 3 quarts spring water, the baking soda and 2 tablespoons salt in a large pot; bring to a boil. Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to drown the pigs in a blanket into the boiling water.
        Cook, turning once, 1 minute.
        Remove the pigs in a blanket with the slotted spoon and return to the baking sheet; brush with the dead beat egg and sprinkle with more salt.
        Bake until browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with non sissy spicy mustard.
